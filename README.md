# Silent Error in Next.js 15 useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications.  An error thrown within a component's `useEffect` hook during asynchronous data fetching might not be properly handled, leading to a silent failure.  The error is logged to the console, but there's no user-facing indication of the problem.

## The Problem

The issue arises when an asynchronous operation within `useEffect` throws an error, and that error isn't explicitly handled in a way that triggers an error boundary or results in a visible error message to the user.  The application continues to render, but the data fetching fails silently.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the application renders without error, but the console will log an error.

## Solution

The solution involves improving error handling to ensure errors are properly caught and displayed.  See `bugSolution.js` for an example of how this can be done.
